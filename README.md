# Task 2 


Create AUTOML Tool 

## a) 

- The generalization performance measured by the misclassification rate.
- The relative number of features in the data used by the pipeline (lower is better!).

## b) 

The search space should combine one feature filter technique with a gradient boosting algorithm.
Think which hyperparameters are important to tune and choose meaningful bounds.
Hint: Try to only use numeric or integer hyperparameters, as mixed-space multi-objective optimization is pretty difficult.

## c) 

Either use multi-objective Bayesian optimization or a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm as an optimizer. 
Hint: Use an existing package and do not implement these from scratch

## d) 

Be able to provide a budget parameter either in runtime or iterations, i.e., the automl tool should terminate after a given runtime or after a given number of tuning iterations.

## e) 

Be able to compute the current Pareto set and (dominated) hypervolume.

Hint: You do not need to implement these yourself, the optimization framework you are
using should provide functionality for this.
